# Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

The Information Technology University (ITU) in Lahore represents a significant milestone in Pakistan's higher education landscape. Established in 2012 by the Government of Punjab, ITU was conceived as Pakistan's first technology-focused "MIT-style" university, with Dr. Umar Saif serving as its founding vice-chancellor. The university's mission emphasizes cross-disciplinary applied research and entrepreneurship, drawing inspiration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's educational model [^1].

## Historical Development

ITU's journey began in the Arfa Software Technology Park, Lahore's iconic high-rise technology hub. The university has since secured a 183-acre site on Barki Road for its permanent campus, currently under construction and expected to be completed by 2025 [^2]. This expansion reflects ITU's commitment to providing state-of-the-art facilities for its growing academic community.
